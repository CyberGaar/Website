    challenge: "Customers refused to provision individual RBAC or federated SSO because engagements often lasted less than two weeks. Five analysts sometimes had to use one admin@client.com account, creating compliance risk, zero visibility and no clear answer to questions like: who deleted the table?",
    approach: "Cybergaar routed access through Cloudflare Gateway and identity-aware device policies. Even where the destination application still saw a shared customer account, the gateway authenticated the individual employee before forwarding traffic and preserved a secondary audit trail.",
    outcome: "The firm gained practical user-level attribution, safer third-party access sharing, better observability across applications and a lower-cost path to compliance evidence without forcing every customer to redesign their identity stack.",
